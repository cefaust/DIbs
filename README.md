# Dibs
  
## Description
One person’s trash is another’s treasure -- but sometimes that treasure is hard to find.

Our app, DIBS, offers a platform where those trying to declutter their homes can give away their used items to those who really want it, and offers affordable options to consumers feeling the weight of inflation.
DIBS keeps usable items out of landfills, and finds people who will treasure them!
